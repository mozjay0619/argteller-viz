Argteller
=========

The argteller package provides the class and method decorators for visual and interactive class object constructor. It frees the user from needing to constantly refer to documentations to figure out what arguments are required and what parameter values are valid inputs. It lists required arguments parsimoniously by only asking the parameters as needed, depending on the previously provided argument values. You can easily encode them in the custom DSL (domain specific language) script.
